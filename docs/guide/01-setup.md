# Set up pstack

In this page you install the plugin, optionally pick models and reasoning effort, and run your first task. A fresh install already uses `grok-4.6` plus per-role effort. Setup is one command plus a short conversation if you want to change that.

## Install the plugin

```bash
grok plugin install aa2246740/pstack-grokbuild --trust
```

Enable it if it stays off (`grok plugin enable pstack`, or Space in the Plugins tab). `grok inspect` should list pstack skills.

## Pick your models and effort (optional)

The Grok Build default is `grok-4.6` for every role and a three-tier effort split on the plugin agents (ship-time `xhigh` / `high` / `medium`, from the grok 1.0.5 CLI usable set). You can start working without `/setup-pstack`. `/setup-pstack` re-detects from live `use one of:` and rewrites that split if it changed. It does not offer `max` unless that list named it.

To override, run:

```text
/setup-pstack
```

[`/setup-pstack`](../../skills/setup-pstack/SKILL.md) detects slugs your `task` tool accepts, shows each role, and asks with `ask_user_question` for models and for reasoning effort. First run can write the shipped default. It writes `~/.grok/pstack-models.toml` and, for a real effort level, `~/.grok/roles/<role>.toml`. It never writes a Cursor rules file.

This repo is the Grok Build port. Grok Build setup configures model + effort. Official Cursor `/setup-pstack` (in Grok Bot or in Cursor) is a different plugin and still writes `~/.cursor/rules`.

A missing override file uses the shipped default. A missing model key in an existing file means omit `task.model`. Skills never send `reasoning_effort` on `task`. Run `/setup-pstack` again to change it.

Set a role to `inherit-parent` or `auto` and pstack omits `task.model`, so the child inherits the parent. For a panel role the model value is an array, and one `task` spawn runs per entry. Effort is still one scalar per role.

## Accept the verification offer, or don't

At the end of setup, `/setup-pstack` looks for a way to prove app behavior, either a `verify-*` skill under `.grok/skills/` or an existing harness. If it finds neither, it offers once to generate one with [`/create-verification-skill`](../../skills/create-verification-skill/SKILL.md).

Say yes and it writes `.grok/skills/verify-<app>/`. Say no and setup moves on.

After setup, start a new session. The model file applies.

## Run your first task

Pick something real but small, and describe it the way you'd describe it to a colleague:

```text
/poteto-mode add a --json flag to this command. text output stays byte-identical. verify both.
```

Watch the todo list. The first item is always "read the Principles section". The rest are the matched playbook's steps copied in, the Feature playbook for this prompt. If `/poteto-mode` skips a step, the step stays in the list with `skip: <reason>`, so you can see what it chose not to do.

From here you can type normal follow-ups. `/poteto-mode` is sticky. It stays on for the conversation until you opt out by saying so.

Next: [Route work through `/poteto-mode`](./02-poteto-mode.md).
